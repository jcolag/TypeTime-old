TypeTime-old
============

C version of TypeTime.

Bluntly, you probably don't want to use this.  Unless you're averse to .NET or Mono, your best bet is the current [TypeTime](https://github.com/jcolag/TypeTime), written in C# and far more configurable and complete.

_This_ version of the program was my original prototype, issued from a morning shell script that fills in the current date.

It works.  It just lacks more than rudimentary bells and whistles and it's little more than a quick hack.
